**Course Description**

<p class="course__description">
In this course you’ll learn all about using linear classifiers,
specifically logistic regression and support vector machines, with
scikit-learn. Once you’ve learned how to apply these methods, you’ll
dive into the ideas behind them and find out what really makes them
tick. At the end of this course you’ll know how to train, test, and tune
these linear classifiers in Python. You’ll also have a conceptual
foundation for understanding many other machine learning algorithms.
